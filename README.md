# StocXTune Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a prototype of an easy-to-use stock market research system that 
can be used by retail investors to research the stock market. Alongside academic aims for this project, it aims to 
undergo a long-term business undertaking that will inform the design and implementation of this project.
To ensure an optimal solution is achieved, this report will discuss and moreover justify the incorporation of 
highly sophisticated technologies, such as the Django MVT, Django Rest Framework, IEX Cloud, and React 
JS. In addition, a variety of stakeholder perspectives and existing systems will be analysed giving perspective to 
the aims and objectives of the project.
